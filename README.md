# Cybersecurity Projects

This is a repository containing cybersecurity-related projects I've worked on to develop practical skills such as scanning, automation, and network security

## Projects

### File Scanner

### Port Scanner
A multithreaded TCP port scanner written in python using the 'socket' and 'threading' modules

### Security Headers Analyzer
A lightweight Python tool that checks for common HTTP security headers on a given URL or list of URLs. This project is designed to help blue teamers and developers identify missing or misconfigured security headers that could leave web applications vulnerable.
